# Development

## Before starting...
Make sure you have a `lib` folder that contains the following files:
  - `Assembly-CSharp.dll`, from `ATLYSS/ATLYSS_Data/Managed`
  - `UnityEngine.dll`, from `ATLYSS/ATLYSS_Data/Managed`
  - `UnityEngine.CoreModule.dll`, from `ATLYSS/ATLYSS_Data/Managed`
  - `Mirror.dll`, from `ATLYSS/ATLYSS_Data/Managed`
  - `BepInEx.dll`, from `ATLYSS/BepInEx/core` or any `BepInEx` installation independent of game
  - `0Harmony.dll`, from `ATLYSS/BepInEx/core` or any `BepInEx` installation independent of game

This will allow you to properly build without errors of missing references.
