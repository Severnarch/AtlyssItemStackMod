# AtlyssItemStackMod
Higher stack sizes? Why, what a ridiculous idea!

## ⚠️ WARNING
If a save slot with this mod is loaded in vanilla Atlyss, **all items will be lowered back to their capped stack sizes**, with **anything over being wiped**.

## Functionality
Sets all stack sizes to 999. That's all it does right now.
